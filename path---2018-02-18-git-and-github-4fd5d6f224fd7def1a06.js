git</h1>\n<h2>What is git?</h2>\n<p>  Alright, we are already familiar to javascript basics, and we might want to create some cool projects.</p>\n<p>  Imagine that you and your friends are working on the same project.\nyou probably are continually writing new source code and  changing the existing source code.\nIn this case the team need some software tools that help them manage changes to source code over time.\nVersion control software (VCS) keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.\nIf a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix\nthe mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.\nDeveloping software without using version control is risky, like not having backups.\nn\nGit is a free, open source and the most commonly used distributed version control system (DVCS) today.</p>\n<p>  Git was started by Linus Trovalds, the same person who created Linux.</p>\n<h2>What is github?</h2>\n<p>   GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories.\nGitHub is a website where you can upload a copy of your Git repository.</p>\n<p>   Git and Github are not the same things:\nGit is the tool, GitHub is the service for projects that use Git.</p>\n<p>   GitHub provides free plans for open-source projects and paid plans offering unlimited private repositories.</p>\n<p>   Before moving on to the git basics, please create your personal github account.</p>\n<h2>Git basics</h2>\n<h4>Install git</h4>\n<p>  $ sudo apt-get update</p>\n<p>  $ sudo apt-get install git</p>\n<p>  $ git —version</p>\n<h4>Create a new directory, and open it</h4>\n<p>  $ mkdir my-directory</p>\n<p>  $ cd my-directory</p>\n<h4>Create some files</h4>\n<p>  $ touch file.js</p>\n<p>  $ touch file2.js</p>\n<h4>Create a new git repository.</h4>\n<p>  $ git init</p>\n<p>  Directory now has an empty repository in /.git/.</p>\n<p>  The repository is a hidden directory where Git operates.</p>\n<p>  Git keeps all of its files in the .git directory.</p>\n<h4>Check the hidden files</h4>\n<p>  $ la</p>\n<h4>Check the current state of the project</h4>\n<p>  You can edit the files and check the stage of your project with the following command</p>\n<p>  $ git status</p>\n<h4>Add changes to the staged area</h4>\n<p>  $ git add  ’ file-name ’</p>\n<h4>Unstage</h4>\n<p>  $ git reset  ’ file-name ’</p>\n<p>  The files listed here are in the Staging Area, and they are not in our repository yet.</p>\n<p>  Staging is a step before the commit process in git.</p>\n<h4>Commit</h4>\n<p>  $ git commit -m “a message describing what we’ve changed”.</p>\n<p>  Now if you check the current state of the project you will see ‘nothing to cmmit, working directory clean’.</p>\n<h4>Undo a commit</h4>\n<p>  We can refer to our most recent commit, using HEAD pointer.</p>\n<p>  $ git reset Head~</p>\n<h4>History</h4>\n<p>  Make a few commits. and let’s browse them to see what we changed.</p>\n<p>  $ git log</p>\n<p>  $ git log -1</p>\n<p>  $ git log -2</p>\n<h4>Add a remote repository</h4>\n<p>  To push our local repo to the GitHub server we’ll need to add a remote repository.</p>\n<p>  ‘Origin’ is the default name of the remote git repository you cloned from.</p>\n<p>  The URL could be your repository on GitHub.</p>\n<p>  $ git remote add origin ’ URL ’</p>\n<h4>Push command</h4>\n<p>  push command tells Git where to put our commits.</p>\n<p>  So let’s push our local changes to our origin repo (on GitHub).</p>\n<p>  The name of our remote is origin and the default local branch name is master.</p>\n<p>  The -u tells Git to remember the parameters, so next time simply run git push.</p>\n<p>  $ git push -u origin master</p>\n<h4>Diff</h4>\n<p>  The main objective of version controlling is to enable you to work with different versions of files.</p>\n<p>  Git provides a command ‘diff’ to let you to compare different versions of your files.</p>\n<p>  $ git diff</p>\n<p>   Compares working directory with index (staged area).</p>\n<p>   It shows the changes that are not staged yet.</p>\n<p>  $ git diff HEAD</p>\n<p>   Compares working directory with the commited version.</p>\n<p>   It shows the list of changes after your last commit.</p>\n<p>  $ git diff —cached</p>\n<p>   Compares index (staged area) with the commited version.</p>\n<p>   It shows the diff between your last commit and changes to be committed next.</p>\n<p>   git diff —cahced will only show changes to files in the “staged” area.</p>\n<p>   git diff HEAD will show all changes to tracked files.</p>\n<p>   If you have all changes staged for commit, then both commands will output the same.</p>\n<h4>Pull command</h4>\n<p>   Pull command incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch\nWe can check for changes on our GitHub repository and pull down any new changes</p>\n<p>   $ git pull origin master</p>\n<h4>Branch</h4>\n<p>   Branching is a feature available in most modern version control systems.</p>\n<p>   Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes.</p>\n<p>   When you are working on a feature or bug you may want to create a copy of the code and make separate commits.</p>\n<h4>Adding a new branch</h4>\n<p>   $ git branch ’ branch-name ’</p>\n<h4>Check branches</h4>\n<p>   $ git branch</p>\n<h4>Switching Branches</h4>\n<p>   $ git checkout ’ branch-name ’</p>\n<p>   when you’re done you can simply merge this branch back into the main master branch (or any other intended branch).</p>\n<p>   $ git merge ’ branch-name ’</p>\n<p>   And finally you can git push.</p>\n<p>   $ git push</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Git",date:"February 18,
