Here's a topic that everyone should speak more openly about: **pay**.

Pay is a topic that people don't talk openly about in Armenian culture
and the tech sector also suffers from that. Here are some rough
estimates of what you can expect to receive as a programmer in Armenia
based off of my own understandings, talking with people in the
industry and having an Armenian business as well that paid
programmers. I've also included some figures for project quotes and
estimatations.

# Earning a salary

```javascript
let studyHard = (hours, person) => {
  let hours_really_needed = hours ** 2;
  let experience = practiceProjects(hours_really_needed);
  if (is_talent_in_armenia(talent(experience, person))) {
    throw new Error('Talent is underpaid');
  } else {
    return consider_overseas_options();
  }
}
```


## Interns

Interns _can_ get paid up to $200 a month, this is a coding based
internship. Most likely in a frontend kind of position, something
React, or Vue based. Cheaper, more enterprisey places use Angular. They
pay much less and offer less growth for interns.

## Entry level

This group usually has about 6-12 months experience, they get paid
about $300-$500 a month.

## Mid level

This group usually has about 12-24 months experience, they get paid
about $500-800 a month.

## Experienced & exceptional to keep

I purposefully don't say senior because it is a nebulous term in this
industry. That said, an experienced programmer, that is someone that
can build up your startup/company usually gets at least $1000 a month
in Yerevan. Places like `PicsArt` can afford up to $3000 a month.

### Caveats

This was assuming Yerevan, Gyumri rates are lower but there are rare
positions for experienced people that can fetch $2000 a month.

# Doing a project as a freelancer

If you're working as a freelancer, that is, contract work then you
must first make a decision. Will your contract work be with people in
Armenia or will it for overseas; this matters for tax reasons.

## Projects solely based in Armenia

I recommend that you first establish the liquidity of the potential
business partner. I usually do this by asking if the potential
employer has at least $4000 at this moment ready to spend on the
project. This attitude will save you a lot of time and potential
misunderstandings later. Mobile development is hot, a mobile app that
takes about 3-4 months should cost at least $6,000-$10,000 depending of
course on various complexities and nuances of the app
itself. Recommend you quickly move on if the other side is
uncomfortable with these dollar figures.


## Projects based overseas, outside of Armenia

Recommend that you open an Armenian business and utilize the tax
savings given to a business for outsources/contract work.
