**This is part two of a two part series, see
[part-one](../2018-03-13-how-yerevan-coder-works) for the beginning of the post.**

Recapping from last time, `yc` is a serverless site as it is hosted on github pages, but we still
have features like user authentication and a database for keeping our
[freelancers](../available-for-work) and for our [job-postings](../hiring-board). We are able to do
this with firebase, an object storage database.
